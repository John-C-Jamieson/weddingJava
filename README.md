## About

[Provide a detailed description of your project, the problem it solves, and its main features.]

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

- **Java JDK 11+** (or your projectâ€™s required version)
- **Maven/Gradle** (depending on your build tool)
- [Other dependencies, e.g., a database, if required]

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git

### Lessons Learned

If I were to start the project over again, I would use a Node.js + Express.js stack 
instead of a Java + Spring stack.
